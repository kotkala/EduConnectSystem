â”œâ”€â”€ app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ app/auth/update-password/page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ app/auth/error/page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ app/protected/layout.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ app/protected/page.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/auth-button.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/login-form.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/sign-up-form.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/logout-button.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/env-var-warning.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/theme-switcher.tsx

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                       # Next.js 15 App Router
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (auth)/               # Route Group
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (protected)/          # Route Group
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/               # Organized Components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                      # Consolidated Utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ supabase/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constants.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ validations.ts
â””â”€â”€ hooks/
```
