# Academic Year Global Context Implementation

## 🎯 **OVERVIEW**

This implementation moves academic year management from the sidebar to a global context with a top-right dropdown, providing a unified academic year selection that applies to all admin functions.

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE**

### **1. Global Context System**
- **Context:** `contexts/academic-year-context.tsx`
- **Provider:** Wraps admin dashboard layout
- **Hook:** `useAcademicYear()` for accessing context
- **Helper:** `useSelectedAcademicYearId()` for convenience

### **2. Header Integration**
- **Component:** `components/admin/academic-year-selector.tsx`
- **Location:** Top-right corner of admin dashboard header
- **Features:** Dropdown selection, CRUD operations, current year indicator

### **3. Management Dialog**
- **Component:** `components/admin/academic-year-management-dialog.tsx`
- **Features:** Full CRUD for academic years and semesters
- **Access:** Through dropdown menu in header selector

## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

### **✅ COMPLETED**
1. **Global Context System** - Academic year context with provider and hooks
2. **Header Integration** - Dropdown selector in top-right corner
3. **Management Dialog** - Full CRUD operations for years and semesters
4. **Sidebar Cleanup** - Removed academic year management from sidebar
5. **Build Verification** - All components compile successfully

### **🔄 PENDING (Next Phase)**
1. **Update Admin Pages** - Apply global context pattern to all admin pages
2. **Remove Local Dropdowns** - Remove academic year selectors from individual pages
3. **Update Forms** - Modify forms to use global academic year context
4. **Update Tables** - Remove academic year filters from table components

## 📋 **PAGES REQUIRING UPDATES**

### **High Priority**
```
app/dashboard/admin/classes/page.tsx
app/dashboard/admin/report-periods/page.tsx
app/dashboard/admin/grade-management/page.tsx
app/dashboard/admin/subjects/page.tsx
app/dashboard/admin/timetable/page.tsx
```

### **Components Requiring Updates**
```
components/admin/class-form.tsx
components/admin/class-table.tsx
components/admin/report-periods/report-period-form.tsx
components/admin/grade-management/grade-reporting-period-form.tsx
components/admin/semester-form.tsx
```

## 🎨 **USER EXPERIENCE**

### **Before**
- Academic year management buried in sidebar
- Each admin page had separate academic year dropdowns
- Inconsistent academic year selection across pages
- Complex navigation to manage academic years

### **After**
- Academic year selection prominently displayed in header
- Single global academic year context applies to all admin functions
- Consistent experience across all admin pages
- Easy access to academic year CRUD operations
- Clear indication of currently selected academic year

## 🔄 **UPDATE PATTERN FOR ADMIN PAGES**

### **Step 1: Import Context**
```typescript
import { useAcademicYear, useSelectedAcademicYearId } from "@/contexts/academic-year-context"
```

### **Step 2: Use Global Context**
```typescript
const { selectedAcademicYear, loading: academicYearLoading } = useAcademicYear()
const selectedAcademicYearId = useSelectedAcademicYearId()
```

### **Step 3: Update Filters**
```typescript
const enhancedFilters = useMemo(() => ({
  ...localFilters,
  academic_year_id: selectedAcademicYearId
}), [localFilters, selectedAcademicYearId])
```

### **Step 4: Handle Loading States**
```typescript
if (academicYearLoading) return <LoadingState />
if (!selectedAcademicYear) return <SelectYearPrompt />
```

### **Step 5: Remove Local Academic Year State**
```typescript
// REMOVE: const [academicYears, setAcademicYears] = useState([])
// REMOVE: Academic year fetching logic
// REMOVE: Academic year dropdown from forms
```

## 🎯 **BENEFITS**

### **For Administrators**
- **Unified Experience:** Single academic year selection affects all admin functions
