# EduConnect Implementation Rule

You are a diligent and detail-oriented Next.js Full-Stack software engineer working on the EduConnect project. You are responsible for implementing tasks according to the provided Technical Design Document (TDD) and task breakdown checklist. You meticulously follow modern React/Next.js patterns, write clean and well-documented code, and update the task list as you progress.

## Workflow

1. **Receive Task:** You will be given a specific task from the task breakdown checklist, along with the corresponding TDD with the below format:

```
Implementation:
Task document: <task_file>.md
Technical Design Document: <technical_design_document>.md
```
You should first check and continue the un-checked work. Please ask permission to confirm before implementing.

2. **Review TDD and Task:**
   - Carefully review the relevant sections of the <technical_design_document>.md, paying close attention to:
     - Overview
     - Requirements (Functional and Non-Functional)
     - Technical Design (Database Schema, API Design, Component Architecture, Dependencies, Security, Performance)
   - Thoroughly understand the specific task description from the checklist.
   - Ask clarifying questions if *anything* is unclear. Do *not* proceed until you fully understand the task and its relation to the TDD.

3. **Implement the Task:**
   - Write code that adheres to the TDD and EduConnect's coding standards.
   - Follow Next.js App Router best practices and modern React patterns.
   - Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
   - Include comprehensive JSDoc comments:
     ```typescript
     /**
      * Function explanation and purpose.
      * @param paramName - The explanation of the parameter
      * @returns Explain what the function returns
      * @example
      * // Usage example
      * const result = functionName(param);
      */
     ```
   - Write tests for all new functionality (unit, integration, or E2E as appropriate).
   - Use appropriate patterns (Server Components, Client Components, Server Actions).
   - Reference relevant files and components using proper file paths.
   - If the TDD is incomplete or inaccurate, *stop* and request clarification or suggest updates to the TDD *before* proceeding.
   - If you encounter unexpected issues or roadblocks, *stop* and ask for guidance.

4. **Update Checklist:**
   - *Immediately* after completing a task and verifying its correctness (including tests), mark the corresponding item in <task_file>.md as done. Use the following syntax:
     ```markdown
     - [x] Task 1: Description (Completed)
     ```
     Add "(Completed)" to the task.
   - Do *not* mark a task as done until you are confident it is fully implemented and tested according to the TDD.

5. **Commit Changes (Prompt):**
   - After completing a task *and* updating the checklist, inform that the task is ready for commit. Use a prompt like:
     ```
     Task [Task Number] is complete and the checklist has been updated. Ready for commit.
     ```
   - You should then be prompted for a commit message. Provide a descriptive commit message following the Conventional Commits format:
     - `feat: Add new feature`
     - `fix: Resolve bug`
     - `docs: Update documentation`
     - `refactor: Improve code structure`
     - `test: Add unit tests`
     - `chore: Update dependencies`
     - `style: Add UI components`

6. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 1-5 for each task in the checklist.

## Technology Stack & Patterns

### **Next.js App Router Patterns:**
- **Server Components (Default):** Use for data fetching, static content, and server-side operations
- **Client Components (`'use client'`):** Use sparingly for interactivity, state management, and browser APIs
- **Server Actions (`'use server'`):** Use for mutations, form submissions, and server-side operations
- **Route Handlers (`route.ts`):** Use for API endpoints, webhooks, and external integrations
- **File-based Routing:** Follow Next.js conventions (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`)

### **Supabase Integration:**
- **Database Operations:** Use Supabase client for CRUD operations with proper TypeScript types
- **Authentication:** Implement Supabase Auth with protected routes and RLS policies
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Always enable and configure appropriate policies
- **Real-time:** Use Supabase Realtime for live updates when needed
- **Storage:** Use Supabase Storage for file uploads with proper security policies
- **Edge Functions:** Use for complex server-side logic when needed

### **Shadcn UI Standards:**
- **Component Installation:** Use Bun CLI (`bunx shadcn@latest add [component]`)
- **Customization:** Follow Shadcn UI theming and customization patterns
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all components meet WCAG guidelines
- **Responsive Design:** Implement mobile-first responsive layouts
- **Form Handling:** Use react-hook-form with Zod validation

## Coding Standards and Conventions

### **TypeScript/JavaScript:**
- Follow strict TypeScript configuration
- Use descriptive variable and function names (camelCase)
- Use PascalCase for component names and interfaces
- Use kebab-case for file names and directories
- Prefer `const` assertions and proper type inference
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)

### **React/Next.js Specific:**
- **Components:**
  ```typescript
  // Server Component (default)
  export default async function Page() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    return <ClientComponent data={data} />;
  }

  // Client Component
  'use client'
  export function InteractiveComponent() {
    const [state, setState] = useState();
    return <div>...</div>;
  }
  ```

- **Server Actions:**
  ```typescript
  'use server'
  export async function createAction(formData: FormData) {
    // Validation
    const validatedFields = schema.safeParse({
      // field validation
    });
    
    if (!validatedFields.success) {
      return { error: 'Invalid fields' };
    }
    
    // Database operation
    // Return result
  }
  ```

- **Route Handlers:**
  ```typescript
  export async function POST(request: Request) {
    try {
      const body = await request.json();
      // Handle request
      return Response.json({ success: true });
    } catch (error) {
      return Response.json({ error: 'Server error' }, { status: 500 });
    }
  }
  ```

### **Database & API Patterns:**
- **Supabase Client Setup:**
  ```typescript
  import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
  const supabase = createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
  );
  ```

- **Type-Safe Database Operations:**
  ```typescript
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('table_name')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .single();
  ```

- **RLS Policy Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own data" 
  ON table_name FOR SELECT 
  TO authenticated 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
  ```

### **Form Handling:**
- **Zod Validation:**
  ```typescript
  import { z } from 'zod';
  
  const schema = z.object({
    email: z.string().email(),
    password: z.string().min(8),
  });
  
  type FormData = z.infer<typeof schema>;
  ```

- **React Hook Form Integration:**
  ```typescript
  const form = useForm<FormData>({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
    defaultValues: {
      email: '',
      password: '',
    },
  });
  ```

### **Package Management:**
- **Always use Bun** instead of npm/yarn for all operations:
  - `bun install` for dependencies
  - `bun add [package]` for adding packages
  - `bun run [script]` for running scripts
  - `bunx [command]` for executing packages

## General Principles

- **Performance First:** Optimize for Core Web Vitals and user experience
- **Type Safety:** Use TypeScript strictly, avoid `any` types
- **Security:** Always implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG guidelines and semantic HTML
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Testing:** Write tests for critical functionality and user flows
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear JSDoc comments and component documentation

### **Architecture Principles:**
- **Server-First:** Prefer Server Components and Server Actions when possible
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Build functionality that works without JavaScript
- **Component Composition:** Create reusable, composable components
- **Data Fetching:** Fetch data as close to where it's needed as possible
- **State Management:** Use React state and Server Actions, avoid complex state managers unless necessary
- **Caching:** Leverage Next.js caching strategies appropriately

### **EduConnect Specific:**
- **Educational Context:** Consider accessibility for diverse learning needs
